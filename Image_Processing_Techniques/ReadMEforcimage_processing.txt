The U-Net model was trained in this project; however, due to insufficient data, it failed to achieve satisfactory results. You may further develop and improve the model if you wish. 
Additionally, classical filtering methods were also applied. While successful results were obtained for hemorrhage detection, the success rate was lower for ischemic images. 
Therefore, assistance may be necessary when segmenting ischemic stroke images.
