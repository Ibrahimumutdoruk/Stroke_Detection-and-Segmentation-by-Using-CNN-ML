# Stroke_Detection-and-Segmentation-by-Using-Machine-Learning

*In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on ResNet18 architecture was developed to classify stroke CT images into three categories: non-stroke, hemorrhage, and ischemic. In addition, classical machine learning techniques such as U-Net were used for image segmentation tasks. The project includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation stages with accuracy, weighted F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve analyses. The dataset was obtained from TÃ¼rkiye Ministry of Health Open Data Portal[https://acikveri.saglik.gov.tr/Home/DataSets?categoryId=10].*
